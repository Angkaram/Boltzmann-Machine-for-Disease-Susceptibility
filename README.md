# A PyTorch project applying a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) structure using [Genomic data](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) to create a simple neural network that tracks or predicts disease susceptibility.

**Project Progress:**
1. July 19, 2024: Using the [book](http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) *Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms* by David J.C. MacKay, I am learning about the complex mathematics and logic that goes into Neural Networks (especially with Chapter 40). With this information, I am also solving some of the exercises from the book (42.5 and 42.8 are shown in the  exercises folder in this repository). 
2. July 24, 2024: For exercise 42.5, I edited the visual format to reproduce Figure 42.3 and the DJCM visual. I also ensured that the recall was asynchronous as opposed to synchronous to guarantee the decrease of the Liapunov function. I also added exercise 39.5 (The Noisy LED), which is about calculating the probabilities of different characters being displayed on a noisy 7-segment LED display, given the current state of the display elements and a predefined flipping probability. My output for this exercise does not mimic a 7-segment LED, but perhaps future modifications will change this.
