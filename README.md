# A PyTorch project applying a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) structure using [Genomic data](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) to create a simple neural network that tracks or predicts disease susceptibility.

**Project Progress:**
1. July 19, 2024: Using the [book](http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) *Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms* by David J.C. MacKay, I am learning about the complex mathematics and logic that goes into Neural Networks (especially with Chapter 40). With this information, I am also solving some of the exercises from the book (42.5 and 42.8 are shown in the  exercises folder in this repository). 
2. July 24, 2024: For exercise 42.5, I edited the visual format to reproduce Figure 42.3 and the DJCM visual. I also ensured that the recall was asynchronous as opposed to synchronous to guarantee the decrease of the Liapunov function. I also added exercise 39.5 (The Noisy LED), which is about calculating the probabilities of different characters being displayed on a noisy 7-segment LED display, given the current state of the display elements and a predefined flipping probability. My output for this exercise does not mimic a 7-segment LED, but perhaps future modifications will change this.
3. July 29, 2024: I start the main project using the prior exercises and the book as a foundation. I begin with researching for Genomic data that is in a format that can easily be handled by a RBM. I find [this](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage_SV/working/20190825_Yale_cnvnator/) from the [1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org). Once I have the data, I must preprocess it. I do so by "binarizing" the data by setting a threshold by which the data is transformed into a 1 or 0. With this binary format, the data is then ready to be processed by the RBM. I created a RBM class that is trained with a simple Hebbian Learning rule (42.1 in the book). I also have simple metrics printed out after training and error-correcting.
